  summary: >
    Hi, I'm a seasoned professional with ten years in IT, mostly focusing on
    deploying infrastructure, supporting users, and finding ways to make things
    easier. Additionally, I bring a background in service and hospitality, so I
    can effectively "do the needful" working with machines and humans alike
    (kidding, but serious).
